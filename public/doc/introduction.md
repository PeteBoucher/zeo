## Zeo is _your_ VR world

Basically, this is a thing that lets you build your VR world with your own hands... ok, and a ton of [mods](https://github.com/modulesio/zeo). &#x1F47E;

You run it and connect with a web browser. Friends can join if you give them the URL. You don't even need a headset b/c it works with mouse and keyboard. But definitely more awesome with a headset.

And your world really _is_ yours, because you run it yourself. You're boss, also everyone knows you're boss because [_blockchain magic_](/docs/vrid) carries your inventory across to all servers.

Plus if you know Javascript, you can [make your own mods](/docs/mods) and get paid in `CRD` ("credits").

## VRID

[Access your VRID here](/vrid).

It's your blockchain identity in VR. It _carries across servers_ because it's not stored on any server -- it's all in the [blockchain cloud](/docs/vrid).

Your VRID lives in a browser cookie, so _make sure to export your keys_ or you could lose everything &#x1F63F;. If you enter your email on your VRID page we'll set you up with recovery &#x1F44D;.

Read all about how VRID works [here](/docs/vrid).
