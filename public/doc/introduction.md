# What's this?

It's your personal multiplayer VR server.

You connect with your browser. Anyone can join if you give them the URL. &#x1F47E;

## What can I do with it?

Connect face-to-face with people across the world. Headsets are supported ([WebVR](https://webvr.info/)) but it also works with mouse and keyboard.

Install a bunch of [mods](/mods) (items, superpowers, games, etc) to your server to keep things interesting. If you know Javascript you can even write your own mods and [get paid to make VR stuff](/docs/payments).

Explore other people's servers and find literal treasures (`CRD` virtual credits), as well as horrors.

Your avatar's stats and inventory <i>carries across servers</i> with the [`CRD` blockchain](https://github.com/modulesio/crds) &mdash; blockchain is the same tech that powers Bitcoin.

## How do I run it?

- **Windows**: download [latest release](https://github.com/modulesio/zeo/releases), unzip, and run
- **Linux/OSX**: `npm i -g zeo`, then `zeo`

## Keyboard controls

## How do I manage my avatar (VRID)?

[Access your VRID here](/vrid).

Your VRID lives in a browser cookie, so _make sure to export your keys_ or you could lose everything &#x1F63F;. If you enter your email on your VRID page we'll set you up with recovery &#x1F44D;.

Read all about how VRID works [here](/docs/vrid).
