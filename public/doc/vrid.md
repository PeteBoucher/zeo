### What is a VRID?

Your Virtual Reality IDentity remembers your avatar and the things you own in VR. Your VRID stays with you even if you move to a different server, because it's stored on a distributed blockchain (the same technology behind Bitcoin).

The most valuable part of your VRID is your wallet. That's what holds all of your _credits_ (money) and _assets_ (property).

You don't have to do anything to get a VRID. It's just a key that points to your identity on the blockchain. It's automatically generated for you if you don't have one.

You can manage your VRID [here](/id). But remember, your VRID is not stored on this site!

### What's are credits?

Credits (CRD) are the currency that's mined by our blockchain network. We use a fork of the bitcoin software and the coins it generates are called credits.

You can literally hold your credit bills in VR by pulling them from your wallet page in VR. You can leave your credits in the VR world for yourself or someone else to pick them up later, and you can trade credits with other players for goods and serives. You can also use credits to buy things, like mods.

Since credits are cryptographically stored on the blockchain ledger, they cannot be forged or faked by anyone (including the developers!). That makes them valuable.

The network is set up so that 50 CRD is mined every 10 minutes, on average.

### Are credits bitcoins?

No.

They are generated in the same manner as bitcoins (mining), but credits don't count as bitcoins, and bitcoins don't count as credits.

In technical terms, we use the same software but a different blockchain.

### What are assets?

Assets are currencies that behave just like credits, except they're called something else, and they're created by users in arbitrary quantities, instead of being mined by the network in fixed quantities.

Anyone can create a new asset with as many copies as they like. Including you! You can do that on your VRID page [here](/id).

Assets might seem pointless at first glance, but they can be used to represent ownership. For example, mods can look up whether you own a certain asset to decide whether you own that mod. And if you don't own, it can offer you the option to purchase it and fund the author's awesome work in making that mod. So assets can actually be quite valuable.

You can trade assets in exactly the same way you trade credits. And of course you can trade credits for assets and vice versa.

### Where do I get credits?

We're constantly dropping them on servers, so you might just be able to find them lying around if you explore.

You can mine credits yourself with regular bitcoin mining software.

Or, if you're too lazy to do either of those things, jusst tweet us your VRID ([@modulesio](https://twitter.com/modulesio)) and we'll throw you some CRD!
