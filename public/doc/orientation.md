## Orientation

So [you're up and running](/docs/getting-started), what next? There's a lot to grok, but dont worry I got ya. &#x1F497;

## Controls

There are two control modes Keyboard Mode, and VR Mode. You pick a control mode when you load into your server. But you can always cancel out by pressing `ESC` and choose the other mode.

The golden rule is this: your mouse and keyboard controls do _exactly the same thing_ as the VR controls. You just use your mouse and keyboard to simulate headset movement and wands. Your mouse controls your headset, keys to control the wands. Here's the controller mappings:

The rest of this orientation talks in terms of VR controls, since that's the whole point of a VR server. But it works the same if you use the keyboard controls above.

## Movement and teleport

Everything on your server happens in 3D space. If you're using a VR headset you can simply walk around, and if you're using mouse and keyboard you can move around with the `W`, `A`, `S` `D` keys.

*Teleport* is how you move beyond your normal room limits, since it's unlikely you have enough physical space to contain your VR world.

To teleport, press the _touchpad_. When you let go of the button you'll teleport to the location you're pointing, indicated by the cursor. You can teleport to a place on the floor, but it works in the air too! You have extra control over the teleport location with the part of the touchpad you're pressing. This lets you target a precise point in 3D space.

Mods can add additional teleport surfaces to the world. These might be floors of different heights, or even walls and ceilings. Watch out for vertigo!

## World scale

*Scale* means the size of the world around you &mdash; and the size of _you_ in the world, because they are kinda the same thing. Another way of saying the world is small is that you're HUGE.

You can control world scale with a 3d pinch gesture using your controllers. Press _both_ `GRIP` buttons and move your controllers together or apart, and the world will change size around you.

When you do this you'll change size from other people's perspective, but the world will appear to change size from your perspective.

## Voice chat

You can enable or disable voice chat by pressing the `GRIP` + `MENU` buttons together. _Voice chat is not on by default_, but it's super useful and highly recommended. &#x1F44C;

Your browser might ask for permission to use your microphone.

## Joining a world

Your friends can join your server anytime if you give them the URL. You can just copy-paste it from your browser.

Just make sure to help them get a hang of things if they're new. A neat idea would be to send them to this page. &#x1F609;

## Additional notes

- Mods can override controls in certain cases (e.g. to avoid messing up a game).
- Gestures are the same regardless of whether you're using VR or mouse + keyboard mode, but the keyboard combinations might be harder to pull off with the keyboard.
- Friends might have trouble joining the world if you don't have the right ports open. You should make sure your router allows `HTTP` on ports `7777`-`7800`.

## Learn the editor

Now that we've gone through the basic controls and stuff, it's time to [learn to build your VR world]. Exciting stuff!
