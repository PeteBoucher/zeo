## Orientation

So [you're up and running](/docs/getting-started), what next? There's a lot to grok, but dont worry I got ya. &#x1F497;

## Controls

There are two control modes Keyboard Mode, and VR Mode. You pick a control mode when you load into your server. But you can always cancel out by pressing `ESC` and choose the other mode.

The golden rule is this: your mouse and keyboard controls do _exactly the same thing_ as the VR controls. You just use your mouse and keyboard to simulate headset movement and wands. Your mouse controls your headset, keys to control the wands. Here's the controller mappings:

The rest of this orientation talks in terms of VR controls, since that's the whole point of a VR server. But it works the same if you use the keyboard controls above.

## Menu

Most things start at the *menu*. The menu is a virtual browser window inside your VR world (which run in your real browser window, browserception).

To open/close the menu you press the `MENU` button. This work anywhere in the world no matter what you're doing; the menu will appear in front of you. Other people can see your menu.

To do things in your menu, you "click" by pointing and using your controller triggers. If you're using mouse and keyboard this means literally clicking your mouse, but note the controls diagram above -- you'll first need to select _which_ controller to click with `Z`, `C`, and `X`.

The menu has a bunch of tabs at the top: `Status`, `Mods`, `Entities`, `Servers`, `Wallet`, and `Config`. We'll go into each of these below.

### Status tab
### Mods tab
### Entities tab
### Servers tab
### Wallet tab
