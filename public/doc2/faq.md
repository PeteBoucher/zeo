# FAQ

#### What are the system reqiurements?

To connect to a server, all you need is any modern desktop web browser. You don't even need a headset -- there's mouse and keyboard support.

If you want to use a headset, you'll additionally need a browser that supports WebVR. Find one [here](https://webvr.info/). This is a temporary requirement; browsers will soon ship with WebVR on by default.

#### What's the tech?

It's almost all just open source Javascript. Highlights:

- [`THREE.js`](https://threejs.org/)
- [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/)
- [`yarn`](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn)
- [`archae`](https://github.com/modulesio/archae)
- [`express`](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [`ws`](https://github.com/websockets/ws)
- [`spdy`](https://github.com/spdy-http2/node-spdy)
- [`counterparty-lib`](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/counterparty-lib)
- [`bitcoin`](https://github.com/btcdrak/bitcoin)

#### How do I run a server?

For most people we provide servers, so you don't have to run anything. All you need is a browser. Find a server [here](/servers).

If you're a developer you'll probably want to run your own server, though. [See setup instructions](/docs/install).

#### How do assets work?

Assets are real Bitcoin-backed [Counterparty](https://counterparty.io/) tokens. Counterparty is a standard way to transact assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

We provide a local web wallet for you to hold your Counterparty assets, perform transactions, and buy content from inside of VR. [Access your web wallet](/wallet).

Since they're just regular Counterparty assets and we never see your wallet keys, you're in control. You can move funds into and out of Zeo VR and trade them on Counterparty markets. These aren't just silly video game "gems"!

#### Can you recover my assets?

No. By design, this is impossible. Keep your wallet keys safe!
