# Introduction

### What is Zeo VR?

It's a realtime virtual reality world builder that runs your browser. &#x1F47E;

Wanna geek out on buzzwords? <i>100% JS/HTML5, hotloaded npm modules, node backend, WebVR, THREE.js, Entity-Component System.</i>

Basically you run this thing on a server, and then you build, run, and share VR content with anyone just by giving them the URL (<i>Tweet friendly!</i> &#x1F426;).

It works with a mouse and keyboard, but supports true VR headets with [WebVR](https://webvr.info/). &#x1F3AE;

<div style="display: flex; background-color: #CCC; width: 560px; height: 315px; margin: 20px 0; justify-content: center; align-items: center; font-size: 30px; font-weight: 400;">Video goes here</div>

### Actually we lied

You don't even need a server.

We built in one-click deploys to a bunch of free deployment services like [Heroku](https://heroku.com/), [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), and [now](https://zeit.co/now). You don't need to pay anyone anything, and you don't need to be a genius. &#x1F913;

### That's just the boring stuff

Things really get interesting when you try the growing collection of modules that add _3D painting_, _sword fighting_, _DJ booths_, and _flyabble spaceships_ to your world. &#x1F680;

It's all built with a drag-and-drop interface with your tracked controllers. Of course, you can drop in your own 3d models, video, and music files too.

### Also great for nerds

If you're technically inclined, a whole new world opens up to you.

If you know [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [node](https://nodejs.org/), and [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/), you can build and publish VR modules to [`npm`](https://npmjs.org/) and load them directly to your face. Or literally throw them at someone else's.

There's extensive [API docs and walkthroughs](/docs/api) when you're ready to get started. And our crack team is [here to help](/docs/contact). &#x1F917;
